# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Java)

A **console-based Java application** that simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, and transaction handling.  
This project demonstrates strong **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and clean separation of responsibilities.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Encapsulation:** Account details are protected using private variables and public methods
- **Abstraction:** Banking operations are handled through service methods
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - `Account.java` → Account data model  
  - `BankService.java` → Business logic  
  - `Main.java` → User interaction & menu
